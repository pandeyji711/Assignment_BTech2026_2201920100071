## Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Highest Peak in a Grid
- **Problem Statement**: 
  You are given a grid where some cells are marked as water (`1`) and others as land (`0`). The goal is to determine the height of each land cell such that the height of adjacent cells differs by at most 1, starting with water cells as height `0`. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute the heights.
  
### Problem 2: Subarray Sum Calculation
- **Problem Statement**: 
  Given an array `nums`, calculate the sum of elements for all valid subarrays where the index of a subarray start is constrained by the value of the current element. The problem focuses on efficiently calculating the subarray sums with proper constraints.

### Problem 3: Count Servers That Communicate
- **Problem Statement**: 
  In a 2D grid, each cell represents a server (`1`) or no server (`0`). Two servers communicate if they are in the same row or column. Count the total number of servers that can communicate with at least one other server.

## Approach and Solution Explanation

### Problem 1: Highest Peak in a Grid
- **Approach**: 
  - Use a **queue** for BFS traversal starting from all water cells (`1`).
  - Maintain a `visited` array to avoid revisiting cells.
  - Increment the height level for each layer of BFS.
- **Solution**: Implemented in C++ using nested loops to initialize the BFS queue and process neighbors level-by-level.

### Problem 2: Subarray Sum Calculation
- **Approach**: 
  - For each element `nums[i]`, calculate the valid starting index of the subarray based on its value.
  - Sum up all elements from the start index to the current index.
  - Use a nested loop to calculate the sum efficiently.
- **Solution**: Implemented in C++ using constraints to limit unnecessary iterations.

### Problem 3: Count Servers That Communicate
- **Approach**:
  - Perform BFS to traverse the grid starting from each unvisited server.
  - Count all connected servers in the same row and column.
  - Use a `visited` matrix to ensure no server is double-counted.
- **Solution**: Implemented in C++ with helper functions to modularize the BFS logic.
