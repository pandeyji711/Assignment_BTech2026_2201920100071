## Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Find Maximum Fish in a Grid
- **Problem Statement**:  
  Given a grid of integers where each cell represents the number of fish in that cell, find the maximum number of fish that can be collected by visiting all connected cells. A cell is considered connected if it is adjacent (left, right, up, or down) to another cell with a positive value.

### Problem 2: Calculate Maximum Length Based on Multiplicative Sequence
- **Problem Statement**:  
  Given an array of integers, determine the maximum possible length of a sequence where elements follow a specific multiplicative property. The sequence starts from any element and continues by repeatedly multiplying the value until the sequence becomes invalid.

### Problem 3: Count Key Changes in a String
- **Problem Statement**:  
  Given a string, calculate the number of transitions between different letters (case insensitive). A transition occurs when two consecutive characters in the string are different.

## Solutions and Approach

### Problem 1: Find Maximum Fish in a Grid
- **Approach**:  
  - Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse all connected components in the grid.
  - Each BFS traversal computes the total fish count for a connected component.
  - Track the maximum fish count among all components.
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Initialize a `visited` matrix to keep track of visited cells.
  2. For each unvisited cell with a positive value, perform BFS to calculate the total fish count.
  3. Update the maximum fish count found so far.

- **Algorithm**:
  - Traverse the grid, and for each cell with a positive value, initiate a BFS.
  - During BFS, sum up the values of connected cells.
  - Return the maximum value obtained from all BFS traversals.

### Problem 2: Calculate Maximum Length Based on Multiplicative Sequence
- **Approach**:  
  - Use a map to count the occurrences of each number in the input array.
  - For each unique number:
    - If the number is `1`, handle it as a special case where the sequence length depends on half of the occurrences.
    - For other numbers, calculate the maximum length by continuously multiplying the current number until it exceeds the integer limit or the count drops below the required threshold.
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Traverse the array and store the frequency of each number in a map.
  2. For each number, calculate the potential sequence length based on its multiplicative growth.
  3. Track the maximum length among all calculated sequences.

- **Algorithm**:
  - Iterate through the map of numbers and calculate the sequence length for each number.
  - Handle edge cases, such as when the number is `1` or when the value exceeds the maximum allowed integer size.
  - Return the maximum sequence length.

### Problem 3: Count Key Changes in a String
- **Approach**:  
  - Traverse the string while comparing each character with the previous character.
  - Count the transitions where consecutive characters are different (ignoring case).
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Initialize a counter for the number of key changes.
  2. Loop through the string and compare each character with the previous one.
  3. Increment the counter whenever there is a change in characters (case insensitive).
- **Algorithm**:
  - Convert both characters to lowercase using `tolower()` for case insensitivity.
  - Compare adjacent characters and increment the counter if they differ.
