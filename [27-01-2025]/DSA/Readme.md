## Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Count of Pairs with Specific Path Length
- **Problem Statement**:  
  Given a tree with `n` nodes, calculate the number of pairs of nodes `(i, j)` such that the shortest path between them has a specific length. The tree includes an additional edge between nodes `x` and `y`, which creates a cycle. BFS is used to compute the shortest paths between all pairs efficiently.

### Problem 2: Check Prerequisites in a Course Schedule
- **Problem Statement**:  
  You are given a set of courses and their prerequisites represented as directed edges in a graph. For a list of queries, determine whether one course is a prerequisite of another using BFS traversal.

### Problem 3: Minimum Pushes for Typing a String
- **Problem Statement**:  
  Given a string `word`, determine the minimum number of pushes required to type the string on a keyboard with a buffer of 8 characters. If the string length exceeds 8, the buffer scrolls to accommodate additional characters, with each subsequent scroll requiring extra pushes.

## Solutions and Approach

### Problem 1: Count of Pairs with Specific Path Length
- **Approach**:  
  - Represent the tree as an adjacency list, including the additional edge between nodes `x` and `y`.
  - For each pair of nodes `(i, j)`, calculate the shortest path using BFS.
  - Maintain a count of pairs for each unique path length.
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Use BFS to compute the shortest path from every node to every other node.
  2. Update the result array to store the count of pairs with the same path length.

### Problem 2: Check Prerequisites in a Course Schedule
- **Approach**:  
  - Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list.
  - For each query `(i, j)`, perform BFS to check if there is a path from course `i` to course `j`.
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Build the graph from the prerequisites list.
  2. For each query, check the existence of a path using BFS.

### Problem 3: Minimum Pushes for Typing a String
- **Approach**:  
  - Simulate typing the string with a buffer size of 8 characters.
  - Calculate the number of pushes required for the first 8 characters.
  - For additional characters, account for scrolling and calculate the extra pushes needed for subsequent segments.
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. Process the first 8 characters as a single batch.
  2. For remaining characters, calculate additional pushes based on their position in subsequent segments.
