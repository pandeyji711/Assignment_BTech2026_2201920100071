## Problem Statements & Approaches

### 1. Valid Rectangle Cuts (`checkValidCuts`)

#### Problem Statement
Given `n` rectangles, determine whether there exists a valid cut that can divide the set into two separate groups.

#### Approach
- Store vertical (`y`-coordinates) and horizontal (`x`-coordinates) segments separately.
- Sort both lists to process them efficiently.
- Use a queue to simulate the merging process and check if a cut exists.
- If at any point, two non-overlapping segments appear, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### 2. Valid Array Existence (`doesValidArrayExist`)

#### Problem Statement
Given a `derived` array of XOR differences, determine if an original binary array exists that satisfies these differences.

#### Approach
- If the array size is `1`, check if it can be derived from a valid binary array.
- Construct two possible sequences based on the first element being `0` or `1`.
- Use XOR operations to validate the entire sequence.
- If either sequence satisfies the derived condition, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### 3. Special Array Queries (`isArraySpecial`)

#### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers and a list of queries, determine if each subarray in the queries is "special."  
A "special" subarray follows the pattern where adjacent numbers alternate between odd and even.

#### Approach
- Precompute a boolean array indicating whether each element follows the alternating pattern.
- Build a prefix sum array for quick range sum queries.
- For each query, check if the number of alternating elements matches the subarray length.
- Return `true` if the subarray follows the alternating pattern; otherwise, return `false`.
