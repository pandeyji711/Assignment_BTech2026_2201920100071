## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, solve the following problems:
1. Minimize the cost of converting one array to another.
2. Find the minimum sum of a triplet that follows an increasing then decreasing pattern.
3. Find the minimum sum of a triplet in an array using prefix and suffix arrays.

## Approach
### 1. **Minimizing the Cost of Converting One Array to Another**
#### Approach:
- Compute the direct difference between corresponding elements of `arr` and `brr`.
- Sort both arrays and compute the sum of absolute differences.
- Consider whether the indexes are swapped to decide the final answer.
- Use `min(ans1, ans + k)` or `min(ans, ans1)` based on whether indexes differ.

#### Complexity:
- Sorting takes `O(n log n)`, and difference calculation takes `O(n)`, leading to an overall complexity of `O(n log n)`.

### 2. **Finding the Minimum Sum of an Increasing-Decreasing Triplet Using Recursion + DP**
#### Approach:
- Use recursion with dynamic programming (`dp`) to store results.
- Explore two options: taking or skipping an element.
- Ensure elements follow the pattern of `nums[i] < nums[j] > nums[k]`.
- If no valid triplet exists, return `-1`.

#### Complexity:
- The recursion depth is `O(n)`, and since we store results, the time complexity is `O(n^2)`, optimizing brute-force `O(n^3)`.

---

### 3. **Finding the Minimum Sum of a Triplet Using Prefix & Suffix Arrays**
#### Approach:
- Construct `v1` where `v1[i]` stores the minimum value from `nums[0]` to `nums[i]`.
- Construct `v2` where `v2[i]` stores the minimum value from `nums[i]` to `nums[n-1]`.
- Iterate through `nums` to find a valid triplet where `nums[i] > v1[i-1] && nums[i] > v2[i+1]`.
- Track the minimum sum among such triplets.

#### Complexity:
- Constructing `v1` and `v2` takes `O(n)`, and checking valid triplets takes `O(n)`, leading to `O(n)` overall complexity.

---

## Conclusion
- The first solution focuses on transformation costs using sorting and indexing.
- The second approach leverages recursion and DP for triplet selection.
- The third approach optimizes triplet selection using prefix and suffix arrays.

Each approach optimizes a different aspect of the problem, achieving efficient solutions.
